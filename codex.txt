## Game Engine

Game engine for text based games. Examples of games are murder mysteries, treasure hunts or escape rooms.
The game consists of a Player, a collection of Locations and a start Location. 
For a game session the state of all Locations, Objects, Actors and the Player have to be maintained (stored for consistency).
A game can be defined as meta data consisting of images and text defining the various Locations, Objects, Actors and Pathways


## Location

A location consists of:

-Image
-Description
-Additional details
-Objects
-Actors
-Pathways

The main screen displays the Location image, Location description and allows the Player to make further inquiries on the Location using text input. The game will answer the text input using an LLM / AI where the information is limited to the details provided. Certain commands are handled directly by the game instead of passed to the AI

## Objects

## Pathways
